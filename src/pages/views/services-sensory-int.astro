          Sensory Integration is a post-graduate field of study that is specific
          to Occupational Therapy.

          It was developed from a body of work by A. Jean Ayres (PhD) and other
          occupational and physical therapists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Literature from fields such as neuropsychology, neurology, physiology,
          child development and psychology contributed to the development of
          Sensory Integration theory and treatment techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all children with learning, developmental or behavioural problems
          have underlying Sensory Integrative difficulties, however the
          following observations are possible signs of Sensory Integration
          dysfunction:
        </p>
        <ul class="views-list-item">
          <li>Activity levels that are unusually high or low.</li>
          <li>Overly sensitive to touch, movement, sights or sounds.</li>
          <li>
            Under-reactive to sensory stimulation. May seem oblivious to pain or
            to body position.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seeking out intense sensory experiences e.g. body whirling or
            crashing into objects.
          </li>
          <li>Coordination problems and/or unusually poor balance.</li>
          <li>
            Difficulty learning new tasks that require motor coordination.
          </li>
          <li>
            Delayed speech, motor skills or academic achievement despite normal
            intelligence.
          </li>
          <li>Poor organisation of behaviour.</li>
          <li>Impulsivity.</li>
          <li>Difficulty adjusting to new situations.</li>
          <li>Poor self concept.</li>
          <li>
            Avoidance or withdrawal from tasks and activities that peers enjoy.
          </li>
          <li>Repetitive or compulsive behaviours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our therapy rooms full of appealing sensory equipment: platforms to
          swing on, bolsters to climb over, trampolines to jump on and ball
          pools to play in.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a child, Sensory Integration therapy is like play and it may look
          like mere play to the adult observer but it is important work, as with
          the guidance of a trained professional, the child can learn to
          overcome issues that probably would not have been addressed in an
          unguided play environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our therapists' knowledge, experience and qualifications enable
          treatment to:
        </p>
        <ul class="views-list-item">
          <li>
            Desensitise the child's sensory sensitivities by slowly and
            respectfully exposing them to specific sensory activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually increase the demands on the child, to result in an
            organised and more mature response to sensory input.
          </li>
          <li>
            Equip parents, guardians and/or teachers with skills to assist the
            child to feel calm and focused.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assist the child to develop age-appropriate self-regulation
            strategies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve sensory discrimination so that the child will develop
            underlying abilities that will enable them to learn new skills,
            interact positively with peers, play more creatively and achieve
            success in activities at home and at school.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To achieve these aims the therapist may recommend a
          <a
            href={build
              ? "./services-sensory-diet.html"
              : "./services-sensory-diet"}

          or an <a

            target="_self"
            class="views-link">Alert Program</a
          >, depending on the child's needs and abilities.
