        <p>
          We are looking for an experienced, paediatric Occupational Therapist
          to join our team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting off it will be part-time/afternoon work from 13:00 to 16:00
          five days per week, with option to expand to a full-time schedule as
          your caseload grows.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer in-practice and school-based OT to children aged 1-13 years.
          The majority of our caseload are children with Autism, global
          developmental delay and special educational needs. We also receive
          referrals from local mainstream schools to address concentration,
          handwriting and motor delays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emphasis is placed on being child-centred and family-focussed thus
          encouraging parents and caregivers to get actively involved in the
          therapy process.
        </p>
        <p>
          This role will allow for an opportunity to work within a
          multidisciplinary team, however, the majority of work will be
          independent from fellow staff members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our existing systems and Apps will be available to streamline
          administration and practice management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Occupational Therapists with a minimum of 5 years paediatric work
          experience are invited to apply. Sensory Integration training is
          essential and training in DIR or AAC would be beneficial. Registration
          with the relevant regulatory bodies will be required. You should also
          have access to your own transport and be willing to commute between
          Pinetown and Durban North once or twice per week.
        </p>
        <p>Position available as soon as possible</p>
        <p>
          Should you be interested in this position please send a cover letter
          and CV to info@kidzcandurban.com
        </p>
        <p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
