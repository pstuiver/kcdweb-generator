          It is important to note that fluctuating appetites, shifts in food
          preferences and changes in eating patterns are considered part of
          "normal" childhood development.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, being confronted with a child who is a picky eater can still
          be quite challenging and stressful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eating stimulates our senses of taste, smell, touch and sight. Food
          aversion or "picky eating" is often the result of children
          experiencing difficulty with the processing of these simultaneous
          sensory inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our therapists can conduct a variety of Sensory Integration
          Assessments to assist with the understanding of a child’s sensory
          needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also provide Sensory Integration Therapy, to improve a child's
          tolerance and processing of sensory information.
        </p>
        <p>
          If our assessment indicates that the mechanics of eating are the
          reason why a child struggles with food, we will adapt our therapy to
          work closely with Speech and Language Pathologist. Should nutritional
          support be required, we can refer to Dieticians and other Health Care
          Professionals.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, we also offer guidance and training to parents on:</p>
        <ul class="views-list-item mb-2">
          <li>Adapting the environment and timing of your child's meals.</li>
          <li>Presenting alternative food and food preparation options.</li>
          <li>
            Developing your child’s willingness to explore, try and engage with
            new foods.
          </li>
          <li>Developing your child's independence during meal times</li>
        </ul>
