          DIR - Developmental Individual Difference Relationship Model
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-bold">DIR</span> is a child and play-based approach where
          we follow your child's lead and interests, while challenging them to move
          up the emotional developmental ladder.
        </p>
        <p>
          These individual treatment sessions develop skills that are essential
          for communication, building empathetic relationships and laying the
          foundations for academic performance.
        </p>
        <p>The aim is to:</p>
        <ul class="views-list-item">
          <li>
            Teach parents/guardians how to assist in helping the child feel
            calm.
          </li>
          <li>Develop the child's interest in the world.</li>
          <li>Help the child to engage and relate.</li>
          <li>Encourage two-way communication.</li>
          <li>Expand social interactions.</li>
          <li>Create situations where the child has to solve problems.</li>
          <li>Encourage imaginative play.</li>
          <li>Develop meaningful use of language.</li>
          <li>Facilitate logical thinking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Floortime</strong> is a technique at the heart of DIR therapy where
          we get down on the floor and play with the child. These skills are also
          taught to caregivers during the therapy process and are often recommended
          as a home program.
        </p>
