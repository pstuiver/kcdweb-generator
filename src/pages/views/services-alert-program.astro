          The Alert Program was developed by Occupational Therapists to teach
          children self-regulation and to teach adults how to support learning,
          attending and positive behaviour in children.
        </p>
        <p>
          It uses the analogy that the body is like a car engine sometimes
          running <span class="font-semibold italic">too high</span>, sometimes
          <span class="font-semibold italic">too low</span>
          and sometimes <span class="font-semibold italic">just right.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Participation in the Alert Program will provide the child and adults
          with a common language and words to describe how the child's
          <span class="font-semibold italic">engine is running.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          It will also provide a range of simple, low-budget strategies and
          activities that can be incorporated easily into the home and into
          school routines, to assist the child with feeling
          <span class="font-semibold italic">just right.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          We have enhanced our Alert Program by adding additional visual support
          and interactive cue cards, to better support children with special
          needs.
