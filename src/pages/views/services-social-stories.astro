            Designing Social Stories
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Children with special needs may not always have perfect social skills
          but with Social Stories, they can learn and develop their skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social stories are simple, personalised tools to help children
          understand and navigate social situations or specific events.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are short narratives using pictures and simple text, to provide
          information about what to expect, how to behave and what others might
          be thinking or feeling in a given situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Stories can be creatively designed and personalised to suit each
          childâ€™s specific circumstances or interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, social stories make a significant impact on children's
          social behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
          They serve as a powerful tool to support social development and to
          navigate the social world with greater ease and understanding.
