          An assessment will typically be the first step in your child and your
          family's Occupational Therapy journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          An assessment provides family members, teachers and caregivers with
          opportunities to share background information and concerns regarding
          the child's development through verbal discussion and the completion
          of written questionnaires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assessment sessions provide our therapists with opportunities to
          interact and engage with a child to establish the child's areas of
          strength and weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activities during an assessment are focussed on developmental tasks
          and educational games specific to each child's age and abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assessment's outcomes provide valuable insight on how to better
          support the child's every day performance and will guide the therapist
          in developing a comprehensive treatment program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The therapist will make recommendations regarding environmental
          adaptations, assistive devices and equipment, behavioural strategies,
          additional therapy and/or medical support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Occupational Therapy practice offers a variety of assessment
          options specific to your child's age, ability and areas of concern:
