          A sensory diet is a carefully designed, personalised activity plan
          that regulates the sensory input that a child needs to stay focused
          and organised throughout the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our brain, through our senses, requires a balanced
          <span class="font-semibold italic">‘diet’</span> in order for us to be
          able to make sense and function in the world that we live in. We naturally
          experience a variety of sensations during the day that impact on our brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a regular, balanced sensory diet, we are better prepared to
          respond appropriately to the demands of the world we live in and able
          to keep our brain properly energised, organised, alert and calm.
        </p>
        <p>
          When children experience difficulties with self-regulation, adults may
          have to assist them in finding the right type of activities to attain
          the appropriate level of alertness for their situation and
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they are not in an appropriate state of alertness, their attention
          may be directed towards the wrong cues or they may fail to alert at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each child has a unique set of sensory needs and preferences.
          Generally, a child whose nervous system is on
          <span class="font-semibold italic">high trigger</span> or
          <span class="font-semibold italic">too wired</span> needs more calming
          input, while the child who is more
          <span class="font-semibold italic">sluggish</span>
          or <span class="font-semibold italic">tired</span> needs more arousing
          input.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our therapists can assist children and families to create a balanced
          sensory diet, that can contain both calming and alerting activities to
          help a child maintain the appropriate levels of alertness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sensory diet will help the child to organise their senses so that
          they can carry out activities to the best of their ability, while
          feeling happy, calm and relaxed.
