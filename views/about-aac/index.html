          Children who cannot communicate effectively, miss out on opportunities
          to play, learn and socialise.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Elsje Stuiver â€“ Occupational Therapy we acknowledge that
          communication is power!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our therapists are experienced in the use and implementation of AAC
          strategies, tools and devices and we work closely with AAC experts to
          find the support that will best suit each individual child.

            <span class="font-semibold italic block">Training and use of Makaton</span>
            Makaton is a system of communication that uses signs, symbols, and gestures
            to help people who struggle with speaking or understanding spoken language.
            It uses hand movements, facial expressions and pictures to convey meaning
            and to improve understanding.
          </li>
          <li class="mt-2">
            <span class="font-semibold italic block">Graphic Symbol use</span>
            Symbols can be pictures, drawings or icons that represent specific words
            or concepts. For parents, the use of graphic symbols can be incredibly
            beneficial to engage in meaningful interactions with their child. It
            provides an alternative way for both parents and children to express
            their needs and thoughts, thereby reducing frustration, enhancing comprehension
            and promoting independence in communication.

          <li class="mt-2">
            <span class="font-semibold italic block">Advice on Speech Generating Devices</span>
            Speech generating devices (SGDs) are electronic devices that produce
            spoken output. Using an SGD, a child can select symbols by touch or by
            alternative methods such as eye gaze or switches, to generate synthesized
            speech. SGDs can be customised to meet each child's specific needs, store
            common phrases and to offer personalised messages. They empower their
            users to connect with others by participating in meaningful conversation
            and social interaction.

            If your child has difficulty making their thoughts, needs and
            feelings known, they may benefit from additional support from an
            Occupational Therapist with a specific interest in AAC.
