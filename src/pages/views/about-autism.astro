          As experienced therapists we understand not only the importance of
          early ASD intervention but also the impact that ASD can have on the
          entire family.
        </p>
        <p>
          As no two children on the spectrum are the same, we take great care to
          develop aims and targets that are specific to each individual child
          and family’s needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our therapeutic interventions are focussed on family involvement and
          education, to generalise skills to the home environment and to ensure
          the sustainability of our recommended programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Therapists are experienced in working with other health care
          practitioners and can provide a multi-disciplinary approach with other
          practitioners that might be providing additional services to our ASD
          clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our therapists are trained and experienced to address the following
          aspects that are typically associated with ASD:

          <li class="mt-2">
            <span class="font-semibold italic">Language and communication</span
            >: Although this area also requires specialised support from speech
            and language therapists, our therapists' knowledge in Alternative
            and Augmentative Communication (AAC) will support your child’s
            ability to communicate.

            and other behavioural techniques are used to promote awareness of the
            child to themselves and to others, appropriate social responses, behaviours
            in public spaces and tolerance to change.
