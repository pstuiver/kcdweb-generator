          Our therapsists recognise the importance of parent, guardian and
          care-giver involvement to achieve maximum gains from therapy,
        </p>
        <p>
          Emphasis is placed on helping parents understand the areas that may
          boost or hamper their childâ€™s development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The therapists' specialised training and experience enable them to
          provide families with strategies, handouts, equipment and other
          resources to best support the child in achieving their full potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the
          <a class="views-link" href="./services-ot-assessment" target="_self">Occupational Therapy Assessment</a>
          and before commencing the therapy process, the parents and child will be
          provided with opportunity to collaborate on setting the goals for therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This goal-setting process ensures that there will be realistic
          expectations and tangible outcomes on which to measure the success of
          the therapy intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, each therapy session incorporates a 5-10 minute
          collaboration between family members and the therapist and opportunity
          for the therapist to provide recommendations with regards to home
          practice and repetition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our therapists are available for private parent meetings as well as
          community and school presentations on Occupational Therapy or related
          topics.
